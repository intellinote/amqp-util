# AMQP-UTIL

**AMQP** is the [Advanced Message Queuing Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol), an [international standard](http://www.amqp.org/) protocol by which applications can publish to and subscribe from a message broker such as [ActiveMQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_ActiveMQ) or [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/).

**amqp-util** is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) library that defines convenience and utility classes on which to build AMQP producers and consumers in Node.js.

*amqp-util* depends heavily on [*node-amqp*](https://github.com/postwait/node-amqp) (which see). This module provides utilities and base-classes which wrap *node-amqp* in support of common use-cases.

## Installing

### Via npm

*amqp-til* is deployed as an [npm module](https://npmjs.org/) under
the name [`amqp-util`](https://npmjs.org/package/amqp-util). Hence you
can install a pre-packaged version with the command:

```bash
npm install amqp-util
```

and you can add it to your project as a dependency by adding a line like:

```javascript
"amqp-util": "latest"
```

to the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` part of your `package.json` file.

### From source

The source code and documentation for *amqp-util* is available on GitHub at [intellinote/amqp-util](https://github.com/intellinote/amqp-util).

You can clone the repository via:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:intellinote/amqp-util
```

Once cloned run `make install bin` to download and compile the module's dependencies and generate the command-line utilities.

## Contents

*amqp-util* provides the following:

 * **AMQPConsumer** - an AMQP message consumer (subscriber) that can be used as-is or extended via sub-classes.

 * **AMQPProducer** - an AMQP message producer (publisher) that can be used as-is or extended via sub-classes.

 * **util.BaseConsumerApp** - a base class for command-line applications that consume messages from a Message Queue.

 * **util.BaseProducerApp** - a base class for command-line applications that publish messages to a Message Queue.

 * **amqp-cli** - a command-line utility for manipulating exchanges and queues.

 * **logging-listener** - a simple command-line application that logs messages to the console.

 * **message-publisher** - a simple command-line application that can publish messages from the command-line.

Explore the [lib](./lib) directory for more.

## Quick Start

For a quick and "easy" demonstration of the framework:

1. Install Node.js and RabbitMQ.

2. Make sure RabbitMQ is running.

2. Run `make clean test bin` to:

    - install any external dependencies defined in `package.json`.

    - run the unit test suite to confirm everything is running properly.

    - generate the executable scripts in the `./bin` directory.

3. Generate the `MyExchange` and `MyQueue` objects used for the demonstration.

   From the project's root directory (the directory containing this file), run:

        NODE_ENV=demo ./bin/amqp-cli create exchange --e.name MyExchange --e.type fanout --e.durable true --e.auto-delete false
        NODE_ENV=demo ./bin/amqp-cli create queue --q.name MyQueue --q.durable true --q.auto-delete false
        NODE_ENV=demo ./bin/amqp-cli bind queue --q.name MyQueue --e.name MyExchange

   (You can replace `./bin/amqp-cli` with `node lib/app/amqp-cli.js` or `coffee lib/app/amqp-cli.coffee`, if preferred.)

4. Launch a `logging-listener`, an AMQP consumer that prints any messages it receives to the console.

   From the project's root directory (the directory containing this file), run:

        NODE_ENV=demo ./bin/logging-listener

   (You can replace `./bin/logging-listener` with `node lib/app/logging-listener.js` or `coffee lib/app/logging-listener.coffee`, if preferred.)

5. Use `message-publisher` to publish a message to the exchange from the command line.

   From the project's root directory (the directory containing this file), run:

        NODE_ENV=demo ./bin/publish-message -m "Hello World!"

   (You can replace `./bin/publish-message` with `node lib/app/publish-message.js` or `coffee lib/app/publish-message.coffee`, if preferred.)

6. If everything is working properly, the `logging-listener` should echo the published message to the console.

## Prerequisites

In order to build this library you'll need to install Node.js as described at <http://nodejs.org/>.

In addition, to run the unit test suite or other demonstrations you'l need to install an AMQP-compatible message broker such as [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/).

See the [`README`](./test/README.md) file in the `test` directory for details.


## Hacking

While not strictly required, you are *strongly* encouraged to take advantage of the [`Makefile`](./Makefile) when working on this module.

[`make`](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is a *very* widely supported tool for dependency management and conditional compilation.

### Obtaining Make

`make` is probably pre-installed on your Linux or Unix distribution (if not, you can use `rpm`, `yum`, `apt-get`, etc. to install it).

On Mac OSX, one simple way to add `make` to your system is to install the Apple Developer Tools from <https://developer.apple.com/>.

On Windows, you can install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/), [GNUWin](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), among other sources.

### Basics

Ensure that an AMQP message broker (such as RabbitMQ) is running locally (or as configured in [`config/unit-testing.json`](./config/unit-testing.json)).

With `make` installed, run:

    make clean test

to download any missing dependencies, compile anything that needs to be compiled and run the unit test suite.

Run:

    make docs

to generate various documentation artifacts, largely but not exclusively in the `docs` directory.

### Using the Makefile

From this project's root directory (the directory containing this file), type `make help` to see a list of common targets, including:

 * `make install` - download and install all external dependencies.

 * `make clean` - remove all generated files.

 * `make test` - run the unit-test suite.

 * `make bin` - generate the executable scripts in `./bin`.

 * `make docs` - generate HTML documentation from markdown files and annotated source code.

 * `make docco` - generate an HTML rendering of the annotated source code into the `docs/docco` directory.

 * `make coverage` - generate a test-coverage report (to the file `docs/coverage.html`).

 * `make module` - package the module for upload to npm.

 * `make test-module-install` - generates an npm module from this repository and validates that it can be installed using npm.

## How to contribute

Your contributions, [bug reports](https://github.com/intellinote/amqp-util/issues) and [pull-requests](https://github.com/intellinote/amqp-util/pulls) are greatly appreciated.

We're happy to accept any help you can offer, but the following guidelines can help streamline the process for everyone.

 * You can report any bugs at [github.com/intellinote/amqp-util/issues](https://github.com/intellinote/amqp-util/issues).

    - We'll be able to address the issue more easily if you can provide an demonstration of the problem you are encountering. The best format for this demonstration is a failing unit test (like those found in [./test/](https://github.com/intellinote/amqp-util/tree/master/test)), but your report is welcome with or without that.

 * Our preferered channel for contributions or changes to the source code and documentation is as a Git "patch" or "pull-request".

    - If you've never submitted a pull-request, here's one way to go about it:

        1. Fork or clone the repository.
        2. Create a local branch to contain your changes (`git checkout -b my-new-branch`).
        3. Make your changes and commit them to your local repository.
        4. Create a pull request [as described here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

    - If you'd rather use a private (or just non-GitHub) repository, you might find [these generic instructions on creating a "patch" with Git](https://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/) helpful.

 * If you are making changes to the code please ensure that the [automated test suite](./test) still passes.

 * If you are making changes to the code to address a bug or introduce new features, we'd *greatly* appreciate it if you can provide one or more [unit tests](./test) that demonstrate the bug or exercise the new feature.

**Please Note:** We'd rather have a contribution that doesn't follow these guidelines than no contribution at all.  If you are confused or put-off by any of the above, your contribution is still welcome.  Feel free to contribute or comment in whatever channel works for you.
